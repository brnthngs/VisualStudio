1, $2.98; product 2, $4.50; and product 3, $9.98.Write an app that reads a series of pairs of numbers
as follows:
			a) product number
			b) quantity sold
Your app should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product. It should
calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold. Use a sentinel-controlled loop to
determine when the app should stop looping and display the final results.*/
